    "\n",
    "Now we understand the basics of different datatypes and data structures, we can start to think about how we might interact with sequential data. This notebook will look at two key areas in Python programming: using `for` loops, and using `if`, `elif` and `else` conditional statements. The notebook is structured as follows:\n",

    "2.1 - *`for` loops*\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2.1 `for` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have collections of data, such as lists or tuples, it is often helpful to iterate over that data to sequentially interact with each element. We use the `for` loop to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the peptide chain for Oxytocin:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",

    "for amino_acid in oxytocin: # iteratively assign each element in `oxycotin` to `amino_acid`\n",
    "    print(amino_acid) # print the current value of `amino acid`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will iterate over the list `oxytocin`, sequentially updating the value of `amino_acid` to the current element in `oxytocin`. Hence, in the first iteration `amino_acid=\"C\"`, then `amino_acid=\"Y\"` etc. Every indented line after `for amino_acid in oxytocin:` will be run at each step in in the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* We can indent the line(s) after our `for` statement with either `Tab` or 4x `Space`. It is good practice to be consistent about which of these you use. Some python interpreters can get confused if you use both methods in the same script!\n",

    "\n",
    "n some cases, we might want to only trigger an `if` statement when two conditional statements are satisfied. To do this, we use `and` and `or`. These operators work by comparing two statements which can evaluate as true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider three statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "oxytocin = ['C', 'Y', 'I', 'Q', 'N', 'C', 'P', 'L', 'G']\n",
    "bradykinin = ['R', 'P', 'P', 'G', 'F', 'S', 'P', 'F', 'R']\n",
    "\n",
    "cysteine = 'C'\n",
    "proline = 'P'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(cysteine in oxytocin) # -> True\n",
    "print(cysteine in bradykinin) # -> False\n",
    "print(proline in oxytocin) # -> True\n",
    "print(proline in bradykinin) # -> True\n",
    "\n",
    "print((cysteine in oxytocin) and (cysteine in bradykinin)) # -> True and False -> False\n",
    "\n",
    "print((cysteine in oxytocin) or (cysteine in bradykinin)) # -> True or False -> True\n",
    "\n",
    "print((proline in oxytocin) and (proline in bradykinin)) # -> True and True -> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that each statement being compared by `and` or `or` are in separate brackets!\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Task:** Use `and` and `or` in a `for` loop to count how many amino acids in `oxytocin`:\n",
    "* Have both hydrophic side chains AND molar mass greater than 100 g/mol,\n",
    "* Have either hydrophobic side chains OR molar mass greater than 100 g/mol.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning: Be careful with the order you put `and` and `or` conditionals. Remember, if `x` and `y` are both `True`, `x or y` will still trigger. Try with the statements in either order and compare the results.**"
